## About These Documents

These strategic scenarios are produced independently by **GENEXXO Vision Limited** to explore how comprehensive categorical infrastructure creates transformational opportunities. They represent thinking about infrastructure ownership - a capability that does not currently exist in corporate planning because the foundational building blocks were not available until now.
