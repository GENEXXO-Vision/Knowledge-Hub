        <h2>The Vision</h2>
        <p>From chaos to control. The internet has grown organically, creating fragmentation that becomes more problematic as AI agents need systematic pathways to information and capabilities.</p>
        
        <p>GENEXXO solves this through intelligent expansion rather than centralized compression—creating specialized territories with consistent XX-signature navigation that both humans and AI can trust.</p>
